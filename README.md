# LibBS
The decompiler API that works everywhere!

LibBS is an abstracted decompiler API that enables you to write plugins/scripts that work, with minimal edit, 
in every decompiler supported by LibBS. LibBS was originally designed to work with [BinSync](https://binsync.net), and is the backbone
for all BinSync based plugins.
As an example, with the same script, you can [redefine the types of function variables with custom structs](./examples/struct_and_variable_use.py), all in less
than 30 lines, in any supported decompilers.

## Install
```bash
pip install libbs
```

The minimum Python version is **3.10**.

## Supported Decompilers
- IDA Pro: **>= 8.4** (if you have an older version, use `v1.26.0`)
- Binary Ninja: **>= 2.4**
- angr-management: **>= 9.0**
- Ghidra: **>= 12.0** (started in PyGhidra mode)

## Usage
LibBS exposes all decompiler API through the abstract class `DecompilerInterface`. The `DecompilerInterface` 
can be used in either the default mode, which assumes a GUI, or `headless` mode. In `headless` mode, the interface will 
start a new process using a specified decompiler.

You can find various examples using LibBS in the [examples](./examples) folder. Examples that are plugins show off
more of the complicated API that allows you to use an abstracted UI, artifacts, and more. 

### UI Mode (default)
To use the same script everywhere, use the convenience function `DecompilerInterface.discover_interface()`, which will
auto find the correct interface. Copy the below code into any supported decompiler and it should run without edit.

```python
from libbs.api import DecompilerInterface

deci = DecompilerInterface.discover()
for addr in deci.functions:
    function = deci.functions[addr]
    if function.header.type == "void":
        function.header.type = "int"
        deci.functions[function.addr] = function
```

Note that for Ghidra in UI mode you must first start it in PyGhidra mode. You can do this by going to your install dir
and running `./support/pyghidraRun`.

### Headless Mode 
To use headless mode you must specify a decompiler to use. You can get the traditional interface using the following:

```python 
from libbs.api import DecompilerInterface

deci = DecompilerInterface.discover(force_decompiler="ghidra", headless=True)
```

In the case of Ghidra, you must have the environment variable `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` set to the path of the Ghidra 
installation (the place the `ghidraRun` script is located).

### Artifact Access Caveats
In designing the dictionaries that contain all Artifacts in a decompiler, we had a clash between ease-of-use and speed. 
When accessing some artifacts like a `Function`, we must decompile the function. Decompiling is slow. Due to this issue
we slightly changed how these dictionaries work to fast accessing. 

The only way to access a **full** artifact is to use the `getitem` interface of a dictionary. In practice this 
looks like the following:
```python
for func_addr, light_func in deci.functions.items():
    full_function = deci.function[func_addr]
```

Notice, when using the `items` function the function is `light`, meaning it does not contain stack vars and other 
info. This also means using `keys`, `values`, or `list` on an artifact dictionary will have the same affect. 

### Serializing Artifacts
All artifacts are serializable to the TOML and JSON formats. Serialization is done like so:
```python
from libbs.artifacts import Function
import json

my_func = Function(name="my_func", addr=0x4000, size=0x10)
json_str = my_func.dumps(fmt="json")
loaded_dict = json.loads(json_str) # now loadable through normal JSON parsing
loaded_func = Function.loads(json_str, fmt="json")
```

## Sponsors
BinSync and its associated projects would not be possible without sponsorship.
In no particular order, we'd like to thank all the organizations that have previously or are currently sponsoring
one of the many BinSync projects.
