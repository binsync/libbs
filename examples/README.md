# LibBS Examples
This directory contains a series of example uses of LibBS in both plugins and as scripting library utilities.
When used as a plugin, LibBS requires a bit more setup to both init the UI components and start the artifact 
watching backend.

1. Passing a generic function to be called on Artifact changes
2. Initing a context menu in any decompiler
3. Generally setting up a plugin as a package with its own installer
